# agent-rules

A curated collection of AI agent rules and skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com).

Rules are defined once and symlinked into your projects. Both agents pick them up automatically through their native conventions — no manual copying.

## Getting started

### 1. Fork and customise (recommended)

Fork this repository, add your own rules and skills to `agents/rules/` and `agents/skills/`, then use the installer to symlink them into your projects:

```sh
REPO_URL="https://github.com/yourname/agent-rules.git" \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourname/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- ~/code/project-a ~/code/project-b
```

To pull in upstream changes later, merge from the original repo into your fork using standard git workflow.

### 2. Download and manage manually

Browse the [`agents/rules/`](agents/rules) directory, download the files you want, and place them directly into your project's `.claude/rules/` or `.cursor/rules/` directory. No installer needed — but no automated updates either.

> **Do not add custom rules to `~/.local/share/agent-rules/`.** The installer runs `git reset --hard` on updates, which will delete any local additions.

## How it works

The installer clones this repository to `~/.local/share/agent-rules` (configurable) and creates symlinks from each target project into that shared copy:

| Agent | Symlink target | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/rules/<name>.md` | Auto-loaded into every session |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` | Applied as project rules (`alwaysApply` via frontmatter) |

Skills (multi-file directories) are symlinked to both `.claude/skills/<name>/` and `.cursor/skills/<name>/`, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

All symlinks point back to the shared copy. Editing a rule inside a target project modifies the source — this is by design.

## Installation

### Quick start

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- ~/code/project-a ~/code/project-b
```

### Install into all projects under a directory

Use `--recursive` to automatically find and install into every git repository one level below the given directory:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --recursive ~/code
```

This scans `~/code/` for immediate subdirectories containing a `.git` folder and installs into each one. Non-git directories are skipped.

### Using an environment variable

```sh
PROJECTS="~/code/project-a ~/code/project-b" \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Prerequisites

- **git** (preferred) — the installer clones the repo with `--depth 1`
- **curl + tar** (fallback) — used automatically if git is not available

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables, set before running the installer.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REPO_URL` | `https://github.com/pecodez/agent-rules.git` | Git URL of the rules repository |
| `REPO_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch to install |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `~/.local/share/agent-rules` | Where the shared copy is stored locally |
| `PROJECTS` | *(none)* | Space-separated list of project directories (alternative to passing as arguments) |

### Examples

Use a custom local directory:

```sh
INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.agent-rules" \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- ~/code/my-project
```

Install from a specific branch:

```sh
REPO_BRANCH="experimental" \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- ~/code/my-project
```

## Updating

Re-run the install command. There is no separate update step — installing and updating are the same operation.

1. The installer pulls the latest changes from the configured repo (`git fetch` + `git reset --hard`)
2. Symlinks are removed and recreated, picking up any new, renamed, or deleted rules

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecodez/agent-rules/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- ~/code/project-a ~/code/project-b
```

## What gets installed

For each target project, the installer creates:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── rules/
│   │   ├── always-ask-agent-mode.md  → symlink
│   │   └── confidence-rating.md      → symlink
│   └── skills/
│       └── <skill-name>/             → symlink (if skills exist)
└── .cursor/
    ├── rules/
    │   ├── always-ask-agent-mode.mdc → symlink
    │   └── confidence-rating.mdc     → symlink
    └── skills/
        └── <skill-name>/             → symlink (if skills exist)
```

## Included rules

### `always-ask-agent-mode`

Requires the agent to ask for explicit user confirmation before making any changes. The agent must pause and confirm at every step — not just at the start of a task. Clarifying questions are never interpreted as permission to proceed.

### `confidence-rating`

Mandates a structured confidence footer on every response with a percentage rating (High / Medium / Low / Uncertain), justification, and sources. Defines mode-specific requirements for Ask, Plan, and Agent modes.

## Repository structure

```
agents/
  rules/              *.md or *.mdc rule files
  skills/             skill directories (each contains SKILL.md + supporting files)
install.sh            installer script
AGENTS.md             project documentation for AI agents
LICENSE               MIT
README.md             this file
```

## Adding rules and skills (fork workflow)

After forking this repo, you can add your own rules and skills.

### Rules

Create a new `.mdc` file in `agents/rules/`:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what the rule does
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---
```

Write the rule content in markdown below the frontmatter, then re-run the installer on your projects.

### Skills

1. Create a directory under `agents/skills/<skill-name>/`.
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file (required).
3. Add any supporting files alongside it.
4. Re-run the installer.

Both Claude Code and Cursor get the full skill directory at `.claude/skills/<name>/` and `.cursor/skills/<name>/` respectively.

## Important notes

- **Symlinks, not copies.** Editing a rule inside a target project modifies the shared source.
- **Re-run after changes.** After adding, renaming, or removing rules in your fork, re-run the installer on each target project.
- **Updates are destructive to local changes.** The installer runs `git reset --hard` when updating, so any files added directly to the local install directory will be lost. Use a fork to maintain custom rules.
- **POSIX sh.** The installer is written for `/bin/sh` compatibility. No Bash required.
- **Shallow clone.** The repo is cloned with `--depth 1` by default, so full git history is not available in the local copy.
- **`.gitignore` the symlinks.** You may want to add `.claude/` and `.cursor/rules/` to your project's `.gitignore` so the symlinks aren't committed.
